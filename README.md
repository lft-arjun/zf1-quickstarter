ZEND FRAMEWORK QUICK START
==========================

This repository tracks the Zend Framework QuickStart, found here:

* http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/learning.quickstart.html

The purpose of this repository is several:

* Support ongoing changes and development of the quick start code base
* Provide a snapshot of how the quick start might evolve in ZF2
* Provide baselines for benchmarking different MVC prototypes for ZF2

Notes
-----

This branch (master) tracks Zend Framework 1.11. You should symlink the ZF 1.11
library into "library/Zend/" (or ensure it's on the `include_path`) in order to
run the quick start.
